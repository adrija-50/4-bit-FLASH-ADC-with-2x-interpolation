# 4-bit-FLASH-ADC-with-2x-interpolation
Designed a 4-bit FLASH ADC using 16 Strong-Arm latches and corrsponding SR latches for holding of decision throughout the clock period.
Additional modification of 2x time interpolation to obtain 5-bit resolution using additional circuitry described in the report.
